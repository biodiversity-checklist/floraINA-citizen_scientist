                <h3>PEER - FLORA KALBAR</h3>
                <p>With this proposed work, we will develop a comprehensive digital reference library, including many thousands of plant images, and internet resources and platforms to facilitate the accurate identification of plant species and the sharing of observations. In January 2014, we will host an intensive training course for twelve parataxonomists in West Kalimantan, to build rigor in data and metadata collection and share plant knowledge. We have already identified many individuals who might be invited. We will focus on West Kalimantan because of its very high plant diversity, the serious threats to that biodiversity, because of the existence there of a particularly active amateur botanist network, and because of the existing related research program of NSF-grantee Webb. The participants will be equipped with tablets pre-installed with a digital library, digital cameras, and netbooks for image storage and curation. They will have agreed to then lead a 15- day expedition to an under-explored area of West Kalimantan, where they will put their skills to work, photographing and identifying plants. The data collected will then be uploaded and integrated into the online project platform. Photographs of some plants will be matched by technicians at the national herbarium (Herbarium Bogoriense). The outcome will be thousands of new plant observation records and the basis for an up-to-date checklist of the plants of West Kalimantan, and digital flora for Indonesia.</p>
                <p>US collaborator Webb will participate in the development of the digital resources, and teach on the training course. The citizen science work proposed here clearly complements and extends the plant inventory and informatics work underway with the associated NSF-funded project.</p>

                <br>
                <h5>Project scope and objectives</h5>
                <p>The scope of the research is to prepare and send out twelve teams of parataxonomists to locations around West Kalimantan. They will collect plant observations (and specimens) that will be directly integrated into a user-friendly online database. These data will contribute significantly to a checklist of the plants of West Kalimantan. Specifically, we will:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare a digital reference library for Bornean plants</li>
                    <li>Develop online resources to assist in plant identification,</li>
                    <li>Develop an online platform for sharing, integrating and discussing field observations. This application will be a general tool for collecting plant observation data for Indonesia.</li>
                    <li>Run a training course in Pontianak, West Kalimantan for twelve participants. They will be instructed on metadata collection, digital photography and in how to interact with the online data-sharing platform. This will also be an opportunity to share botanical knowledge and tips.</li>
                    <li>Encourage and fund these twelve participants to each take a 15-day field trip to different botanically critical sites in West Kalimantan</li>
                    <li>Assist with post-expedition plant identification and sharing</li>
                    <li>Integrate findings with existing plant lists to produce a preliminary checklist for the plants of West Kalimantan</li>
                </ol>  
                <br>
                <h5>FIELD EXPEDITIONS</h5>
                <p>As a requirement for participating in the training course, the participants will have agreed to lead a small expedition to a forested part of West Kalimantan, in order to put their new skills and hardware into practice and actually collect quality observations about the flora of West Kalimantan. We have budgeted $1,500 for a 15-day trip for three people. All potential participants have extensive field experience, and should find the logistics of these expeditions easy. They will usually have been barred from visiting sites simply due to reasons of funding.</p>
                <p>We expect expeditions to be led to: i) the four National Parks (Betung Kerihun, Danau Sentarum, Bukit Baka and Gunung Palung, ii) other protected areas (Pulau Karimata, Gunung Niut, Kendawangan), but also iii) remaining forests in logging concessions and industrial oil palm landscapes. The locations will be discussed and decided upon during the training course.</p>
                <p>During the expeditions, the participants will make observations using best-practice protocols, georeferencing each observation, taking multiple photographs per plant, and collecting dense metadata; see metadata and image samples at the online database of the the associated NSF project: http://xmalesia.info/xmdata/index.php. As usual, due to the ‘many common, few rare’ nature of biological communities, most of the plants encountered will be common, and the participants should already know most of them: they can be recorded by name and just a few voucher photographs. Rarer, ‘more interesting’ plants will be studied more carefully. Having direct access to a digital library in the field will also make it easier to know what is important to record. Where fertile (flowering or fruiting) material is available, standard plant collections will be made. The local Pontianak university, U Tanjung Pura, has expressed interest in developing a basic herbarium, and we will work together with them and with the local forestry student association (Sylva) to provide resources for drying specimens. If during the data sharing and identification phase it turns out that the collections are rare and/or interesting, single duplicates of these collections will then be sent to Herbarium Bogoriense for mounting and curation.</p>
                <br>
                <h5>DATA SHARING AND CHECKLIST CREATION</h5>
                <p>After their expeditions, the project will assist the twelve parataxonomists with post-expedition plant identification and sharing. They will be connected with professional plant identificators based in Herbarium Bogoriense (BO), and will choose 20 of the most challenging plant samples to share digitally with BO staff. The plant identificators then provide professional identification service and return the species names to the parataxonomist. This training stage introduce the importance of networking and sharing data in expedite the development of precise, accurate and valid plant checklist.</p>
                <p>As described above, the project portal will also make it easy and fun to browse each other’s collection images and will provide direct access to the best resources (checklists, interactive keys, image collections) for identifying their observed taxa. As observations are uploaded and given determinations, the system will automatically incorporate these new data into a dynamically generated checklist, which can be accessed and downloaded in a number of formats (see Data Sharing section 3.h below).</p>
